# AdventchureTyme
## (We Promise.all you'll have a good time)

## Synopsis
AdventchureTyme(no copyright issues here), is a platform to share and experience Adventures whether competitive or just for fun. In it's current iteration AdventchureTyme is demoed as a scavenger hunt game whereby the user is fed questions and pictures are submitted as answers. Integration into
Twilio allows for a text messaging platform and mobile play while Google Vision handles the validation of user answers. 


## Features
- More fun than a barrel of monkeys
- Unique delivery system using Twilio
- Answers are actually pulled using Google Vison AI to grab text from images

## Successes
- Avoided scope creep. Sufficient pre-planning kept us all on the same page.
- We never corrupted the master branch :)

## Challenges
- Dealing with issues in hindsight concerning game logic/user flow that didn't come up during planning phases
- .then .then .then .then .then......Promise chains forcing a particular sequence to occur
- Pivoting to Google Vision when the first planned photo comparison with phash failed
